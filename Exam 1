                ### GENDID_DESCRIBEmale or genders that are described as male fail to reject the Null Hypt because the P value is greater
                #### than the level of significance. This means again there is no differnect between the ind and dep variables.

summary(Division_2)
#### I reject the Null Hypt that there is no correclation between the ind and dep variable because there is a high level of signaficance which is indicated byt the Three stars 
#### and a low P value.  The mean we must honor the alternative hypthesis that there is a correclation between anywork and income.
